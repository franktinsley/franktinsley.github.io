    <h1>Privacy Policy for CarStream for Twitch</h1>
    <p class="last-updated"><em>Last Updated: August 2023</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is CarStream for Twitch's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you through our app, CarStream for Twitch.</p>

    <h2>Important Note About Data Storage</h2>
    <p><strong>CarStream for Twitch does not operate its own backend servers.</strong> All app functionality operates directly on your device, and we do not collect or store your personal information on any servers of our own. Authentication with Twitch happens directly between your device, Apple's services, and Twitch's servers.</p>

    <h2>Information We Process</h2>

    <h3>Personal Information</h3>
    <p>We process (but do not store on our servers) the following types of information when you use CarStream for Twitch:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">Authentication data</span>: If you choose to connect a Twitch account, we facilitate authentication tokens provided by Twitch to enable you to access your Twitch content. These tokens are only stored locally on your device. We do not have access to or store your Twitch username or password on any remote servers.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Subscription information</span>: When you purchase a CarStream Plus subscription, Apple's App Store handles all payment processing. We receive confirmation of your subscription status through Apple's systems but do not have access to your payment details. Subscription status is managed entirely by Apple.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Usage data</span>: Basic anonymous usage statistics may be collected through Apple's standard app analytics tools to help us improve the app. This information is anonymized and cannot be used to identify you personally.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data Not Collected</h3>
    <p>We do NOT collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your precise location data</li>
        <li>Your contacts or address book</li>
        <li>Your photos or media files</li>
        <li>Your microphone or camera data</li>
        <li>Your browsing history outside our app</li>
        <li>Any personal data on our own servers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information processed through the app to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide the core functionality of CarStream for Twitch on your device</li>
        <li>Verify your subscription status through Apple's systems</li>
        <li>Facilitate authentication with Twitch when you choose to connect your account</li>
        <li>Understand general app usage patterns to make improvements (via anonymized analytics)</li>
        <li>Respond to your requests or questions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>Because we don't operate our own servers or store your personal data, we don't share or sell your information. However, your use of our app involves these third parties:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">Apple</span>: Handles all subscription management, payments, and may collect usage analytics according to their privacy policy.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Twitch</span>: When you connect your Twitch account, our app communicates directly with Twitch's servers using their API. Your use of Twitch through our app is subject to Twitch's own Privacy Policy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may only disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid legal requests.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since we don't collect or store your data on our servers, your main security considerations involve the security of your device and the third-party services we integrate with (Apple and Twitch). We recommend keeping your device and operating system updated and using strong passwords for your Apple ID and Twitch accounts.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we don't collect your personal data on our servers, there is no need to request access, correction, or deletion of data from us. However, you may have rights regarding your data with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Apple: Contact Apple to manage data associated with your Apple ID or App Store purchases</li>
        <li>Twitch: Contact Twitch to manage data associated with your Twitch account</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our app may contain links to or allow you to interact with third-party websites and services, including Twitch. These third parties have their own privacy policies, and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for their policies or processing of your personal information.</p>

    <h2>California Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p>California residents may have additional rights regarding personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and other state laws. However, as we do not collect or store personal information on our servers, many of these rights may not be applicable to data processed solely within our app.</p>
